# Credit Risk Classification

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to classify a given loan as healthy or high-risk using supervised machine learning. This will be accomplished by utilization of a logistic regression model; the model will be trained based on financial information of past loans. The model will then be evaulated using resampled data to determine the performance of the model is affected. 

The features that will be considered in the model are as followed:
* _loan_size_: the original loan amount
* _interest_rate_: rate of interest 
* _borrower_income_: annual income of loan borrower
* _debt_to_income_: all monthly debt payments divided by borrower_income
